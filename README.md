Connect 4 is a board game that can be played alone or with a friend. 
The aim of the game is to align four tiles of the same color in any direction. 
Each player, human or AI, takes turns placing its tiles on a 7x6 grid, 
while preventing the opponent from winning. 
The game ends when one of the players has four tiles perfectly aligned or when a player gives up.

With its vivid colors, our user interface is simple and intuitive.
